            <p>My name is Sara Taylor. Never in a million years did I think I would be in a Full-Stack web design certification program. I haven't been in a terminal of a computer since my dad brought home a Commador 64 when I was a teenager. But here I am making the leap! </p>
            <p>I had been working on my own website in Wordpress for several months when my 19 yo came home and I expressed my frustration. His employee who I had hired to help me, wasnt getting back to me on how to make my site ADA compliant, he said "Mom, your questions to {So-n-so} made him have to fix our site. You just need to figure this stuff out yourself and learn how to do this from scratch." </p>
            <P>He convinced me that I was good at math, had the mind of a designer and that I could go back to school and firgure it all out, afterall, I had recently gotten laid off along with 20% of the workforce at my previous company ...So Here I am. Let's get this party started.</P>
