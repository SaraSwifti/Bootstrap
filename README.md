# Bootstrap
Well, I feel like I just got myself unstuck on several issues but am running out of time so I must turn this in as is. 

If I had more time, I would make it so that the about me section's photo wouldn't shrink so much and that the top nav bar would not loose it's background color at a smaller size

I would also redo the columns in the portfolio page and add a media query to make them colapse to a single column. 

I am personally looking forward to doing my own coding on these types of things but in the CSS grid system. Once I get more proficient in the languages, I think I can do it faster than trying to figure out bootstrap's naming conventions and how to make adjustments. It is nice to know that this is available when in a pinch.
